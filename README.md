# Interesting numbers
A program designed to display interesting facts about numbers. The user has the opportunity to select any number or let the application choose a random number. It is also possible to select a range of numbers and even a date. 
Also, as an addition, a firebase has been introduced with the ability to initialize the user and save the number of requests in the user profile.

As an addition, a type of store has been introduced with the ability to add cards (products) both directly from the application, if the user is an admin, and using the web interface on the firebase website. You can assign your favorite products, you can add categories (headers), everything will be automatically sorted and displayed on the application screen. You can also set the sequence of categories, which are first and which are at the end of the page.

### Why did I write this project?
___
In order to show your capabilities as a portfolio, and to acquire new and improve old skills and technologies.
I really enjoy writing code. Create applications from simple to complex multi-level ones. This really fascinates me...
